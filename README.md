## 🧠 Ariana — Human-Centered AI Developer

I’m a **Computer Science graduate** passionate about building **AI that understands and connects with people**.  
My work blends **machine learning, cognition and design thinking** to create systems that are not only intelligent.

I focus on developing solutions at the intersection of:
- human-centered AI  
- emotion and behavior understanding  
- personalized and adaptive experiences  
- health technology innovation

### 🔬 Work in Progress

- **NeuroMote** *([Bachelor’s Thesis](https://github.com/AriiSM/NeuroMote))*  
  A multimodal emotion recognition system combining audio and video signals for affective computing applications.  
  Focused on detecting and interpreting emotional states through tone and facial expression fusion.


- **LipReadSense** *(Master’s Thesis Project)*  
  A deep learning-based lip reading system that decodes spoken language **solely from lip movements**, without relying on any audio input.
