# Hi there! I'm Ariana â€“ but you can call me Ari ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student with a soft spot for **AI that connects with people**.  
I build intelligent systems that don't just compute.

Right now, Iâ€™m blending **code, cognition, and curiosity** to bring projects to life at the intersection of:
- human-centered AI
- emotion understanding
- personalized experiences
- health tech innovation

Letâ€™s make technology feel a little more... human.

Always open to collaborations, especially on AI projects with a human twist.

### What I'm Into

I am passionate about developing AI systems that are intuitive, human-centered, and applicable to real-world scenarios. My current focus includes:

- **Multimodal AI**: Integrating audio and visual data to interpret human emotions, as explored in my project *NeuroMote*.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhancing pre-trained language models with retrieval mechanisms to create personalized, context-aware conversational agents, exemplified by my *Personality-Food Chatbot* project.
- **Similarity Search Engines**: Developing systems from the ground up that utilize vector embeddings and FAISS for efficient and accurate information retrieval.
- **Head Gesture Recognition**: Implementing custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to facilitate non-verbal human-computer interactions.
- **Cybersecurity and User Education**: Creating interactive web applications that educate users about online threats through gamification, as demonstrated in my *Trust Issues* project.
- **AI Applications in Healthcare**: Applying machine learning techniques to biomedical data to support drug repurposing and discovery, as seen in my *Gene Explorer* project.
